- 👋 Hi, I’m @Consciousphrog, also known as Jowita Olszewska and (less formally) as Karo or Jon
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, but mostly its narrative aspect as a game writer and quest designer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# (since I've been working mostly in Unity) but I'd love to expand to other engines eventually!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require any kind of narrative/story guidance - I'd be happy to help!
- 📫 You can reach me on discord as Consciousphrog or on twitter under the same name
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you have some time (like, a lot of time) to spare - ask me about anything audiodrama related! You'll get bonus points for The Magnus Archives.
